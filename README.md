### Hello 👋

I'm a full-stack software engineer based out of Salt Lake City. I'm currently working freelance and part-time for [Infinium](https://github.com/Infinium8).

My personal website is [xplato.dev](https://xplato.dev), which contains more information about my skills and focus.

My projects are spread between [my personal GitHub](https://github.com/xplato), [Infinium's GitHub](https://github.com/Infinium8), and [Codeberg](https://codeberg.org/xplato).

If you have any questions, would like to discuss a new project idea or something else, feel free to [reach out.](http://localhost:3000/#contact)
