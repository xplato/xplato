### Hello ðŸ‘‹

You can find my personal website at [attom.space](https://attom.space). I use GitHub only for collaborating on open-source projects that don't use [Codeberg](https://codeberg.org/). All of my repositories are available there at: [codeberg.org/athena](https://codeberg.org/athena) (don't forget to check my organizations!)

With that said, I'm spending lots of time working on open-source projects for my business, [Infinium](https://infinium.earth). The relevant GitHub is found at [Infinium8.](https://github.com/Infinium8)

### Stuff I'm working on

- [useUndoable](https://github.com/Infinium8/useUndoable): React hook for undo/redo-ing state changes.
- [Supervisor](https://github.com/Infinium8/Supervisor): Watch directories for changes, invoke scripts.
- [JupiterUI](https://github.com/Infinium8/JupiterUI): An elegant and reliable UI kit for web artisans.
