### Hello 👋

You can find my personal website at [attom.space](https://attom.space). I use GitHub only for collaborating on open-source projects that don't use [Codeberg](https://codeberg.org/). All of my repositories are available there at: [codeberg.org/athena](https://codeberg.org/athena) (don't forget to check my organizations!)
